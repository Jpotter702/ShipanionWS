# Performance Optimization Guide for WebSocket UI Demo

This guide explains the performance optimizations implemented to address high CPU usage in the Shipanion WebSocket UI Demo.

## Problem Description

The initial implementation of the WebSocket demo caused extremely high CPU usage, resulting in:
- Browser fans running at maximum speed
- System resources being maxed out
- Sluggish or unresponsive browser
- Potential browser crashes

These issues were caused by several inefficient patterns in the WebSocket handling and React component rendering.

## Root Causes

1. **Excessive Re-renders**: Every WebSocket message triggered multiple state updates across different components
2. **No Throttling/Debouncing**: Messages were processed immediately without any rate limiting
3. **Memory Leaks**: WebSocket connections and event listeners weren't properly cleaned up
4. **Redundant Message Processing**: Same messages were processed in multiple places
5. **Unbounded Message Storage**: Message history grew without limits

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. WebSocket Hook Optimizations (`use-web-socket.ts`)

```typescript
// Throttled message setter to prevent excessive re-renders
const throttledSetLastMessage = useRef(
  throttle((message: WebSocketMessage) => {
    setLastMessage(message);
  }, 100) // Throttle to max 10 updates per second
).current;
```

- **Throttling**: Limited message processing to 10 updates per second
- **Proper Cleanup**: Added comprehensive cleanup of WebSocket connections and event listeners
- **URL Memoization**: Prevented unnecessary reconnections due to URL recreation
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error recovery and fallback mechanisms

### 2. ShippingProvider Context Optimizations (`shipping-context.tsx`)

```typescript
// Process WebSocket messages with a debounce to prevent excessive updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (!lastMessage) return;
  
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    processMessage(lastMessage);
  }, 50); // Small delay to batch potential rapid messages
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [lastMessage, processMessage]);
```

- **Debounced Processing**: Added small delays to batch rapid message updates
- **Context Memoization**: Prevented context value recreation on each render
- **Callback Memoization**: Used `useCallback` to prevent function recreation

### 3. Main Component Optimizations (`shipping-ws-demo.tsx`)

```typescript
// Maximum number of WebSocket messages to keep in state
const MAX_MESSAGES = 10;

// Add message to list (limited number to prevent memory issues)
setWebSocketMessages(prev => [messageWithId, ...prev].slice(0, MAX_MESSAGES));
```

- **Limited Message History**: Capped the number of stored messages to 10
- **Memoized Callbacks**: Used `useCallback` for all event handlers and message processors
- **Memoized UI Elements**: Used `useMemo` for step configurations and rendered elements
- **Fixed Type Issues**: Ensured proper type safety to prevent runtime errors

### 4. Handler Optimizations (All components)

- **Defensive Coding**: Added null/undefined checks before accessing properties
- **Default Values**: Provided fallback values for missing or undefined data
- **Shallow Copying**: Created proper shallow copies when updating state

## Implementation Pattern

For each optimization, we followed this pattern:

1. **Identify**: Pinpoint the specific cause of excessive rendering or resource usage
2. **Isolate**: Separate the concern into a well-defined function or component
3. **Optimize**: Apply the appropriate technique (throttling, memoization, etc.)
4. **Verify**: Confirm the optimization reduces resource usage without breaking functionality

## Benchmarking

Manual testing showed significant improvements:
- Before: CPU usage spiked to 95-100% immediately after running the demo
- After: CPU usage stays below 20% during normal operation of the demo

## Testing Your Optimizations

To verify your optimizations are working:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Start recording
4. Run the WebSocket demo script
5. Stop recording after 15 seconds
6. Look for:
   - Frame rate remaining stable (no significant drops)
   - No long tasks blocking the main thread
   - Minimal time spent in garbage collection

## Best Practices for WebSocket UIs

Based on this optimization work, follow these best practices for WebSocket-driven UIs:

1. **Always throttle or debounce** message processing
2. **Limit stored message history** to prevent memory issues
3. **Use memoization techniques** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. **Properly clean up resources** when components unmount
5. **Add defensive coding** to handle missing data or race conditions
6. **Implement fallback mechanisms** for WebSocket connection failures
