*Have we achieved the following requirements for this phase?*

                                ↑
                          POST /send-message
                                ↑
                     Used by test tools or internal API
                     
1. Is the FastAPI server up and running?
2. Can clients connect to /ws
3. Will send-message POST broadcast to all connected clients?
4. Cam Frontend useWebSocket.ts receive messages and stores them in state?
5. Are the Dispatcher and type interfaces scaffolded and ready for the next phase?

Augment
Let me analyze each requirement based on the provided code:

FastAPI Server Running ✅
backend/main.py shows a properly configured FastAPI server with CORS enabled
WebSocket endpoint at /ws is implemented
Basic connection management is in place
Client WebSocket Connection ✅
/ws endpoint is properly implemented with connection handling
Connection manager handles accept/disconnect lifecycle
Error handling for WebSocketDisconnect is in place
POST /send-message Broadcasting ✅
POST /send-message endpoint is implemented
Uses ConnectionManager.broadcast() to send to all connections
Messages are enriched with timestamp and requestId
Proper message validation using IncomingMessage Pydantic model
Frontend Reception ✅
useWebSocket.ts hook properly:
Maintains connection state
Stores messages in state array
Provides sendMessage function
Handles connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
Dispatcher & Types ✅
MessageTypes.ts defines all required message types
WebSocketMessage interface is properly defined
dispatchMessageByType.ts provides message routing functionality
Type system is ready for extending with new message handlers
All core requirements appear to be met. The system can:

Accept WebSocket connections
Broadcast messages via WebSocket and REST
Handle message types
Maintain connection state
Route messages to appropriate handlers
The foundation is solid for building the next phase of functionality.
