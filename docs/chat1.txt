**The WebSocket connection is now secured with JWT-based authentication**.

**Production-ready posture** with:

-  Per-user/session identification
-  Expiry and timeout control
-  Reconnection with secure token reuse
-  Foundation for session logging, access control, and quote traceability

## System Now Looks Like:

```plaintext
[ElevenLabs Voice Agent]
      ↓ emits client_tool_call
[WebSocket Server (FastAPI)]
      ↓ validates JWT (python-jose)
[Backend REST API (/get-rates)]
      ↓ result
[WebSocket Server] → emits client_tool_result
      ↓
[CompanionUI Frontend] ← mirrored update
```

| Capability                  | Now Possible? |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Authenticated socket connects | ✅ Yes |
| User-level quote tracking     | ✅ Yes |
| Secure reconnections          | ✅ Yes |
| Session replays               | ✅ Phase 5 ready |
| Rate limiting by user         | ✅ Add in Phase 6 |

Todo:
- Draft a JWT payload spec for voice agent vs frontend users
- Implement session propagation through token claims

**session linking** or start testing reconnect logic. You’re building a logistics platform that would make Twilio blush. 📦📡
