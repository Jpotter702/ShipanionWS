Perfect follow-up. Here's the key distinction:

---

## 🧠 What Kind of Message Is It?

### ✅ It is a **WebSocket message**, **not** a webhook.

---

## 📡 Message Type: `client_tool_call`
> Sent by the **ElevenLabs LLM agent** over an open **WebSocket connection**

### 🔁 This is **real-time**, persistent, bidirectional communication.

---

## 🔁 The Flow Looks Like This:

```plaintext
[ElevenLabs LLM Agent (Bob)] 👂 User says ZIP and weight
      ↓
[LLM decides to call a tool]
      ↓
Sends WebSocket message:
{
  "type": "client_tool_call",
  "tool_name": "get_shipping_quotes",
  "parameters": {...}
}
      ↓
[WebSocket Server] handles it immediately
```

✅ This avoids the **delays and overhead of webhooks**, and allows:
- Real-time back-and-forth
- Session-aware message handling
- Bidirectional syncing with CompanionUI + Bob

---

## 🔗 So When Are Webhooks Used?

Webhooks are only used in **older, stateless integrations** (like Stripe, GitHub, or the original ElevenLabs v1 SDK).

In this setup — using ElevenLabs **Conversational AI** with Server Tools —  
**everything runs over WebSockets.**

---

## TL;DR

| Message Type         | Transport     | Who Sends It     | Purpose                         |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| `client_tool_call`   | 🧠 WebSocket   | ElevenLabs Agent | Run your backend logic (e.g. rate quote) |
| `client_tool_result` | 🧠 WebSocket   | Your Server      | Send result back to Bob/LLM     |
| `contextual_update`  | 🧠 WebSocket   | Your Server      | Send state sync to Bob’s brain  |
