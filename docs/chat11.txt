🎯 **Exactly.** You're not just building an endpoint — you're wiring up a **real-time neural link** between Bob and your backend.

## 🧠 The WebSocket = Your Real-Time Brainstem

Once the connection opens, **Bob and your WebSocket server are always in sync** — no polling, no delay, no webhook lag.

### 📡 Real-Time Protocol Loop:

```plaintext
🤖 Bob (LLM agent)
⬇️ Sends: "client_tool_call" (e.g. get_shipping_quotes)

🧠 Your WebSocket Server
🔄 Does work → fetches rates
⬆️ Sends: "client_tool_result" (with quotes)

🤖 Bob receives
🗣️ Speaks: “UPS Ground is your cheapest option.”
⬇️ Optionally sends: "contextual_update"

🧠 Server receives
↩️ Can mirror to UI, update stepper, etc.
```

## 🔐 Connection Characteristics

| Feature            | Status          |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Always connected   | ✅ Until user ends session or timeout |
| Session-aware      | ✅ Yes (via `session_id` or token)     |
| Bidirectional      | ✅ Send + receive in real time         |
| Webhook-free       | ✅ 100% socket-native                  |

## 🤯 Why This Is Huge

- You can **send updates to Bob** without the user asking anything
- Bob can **respond mid-flow** — “Hold on, FedEx Ground is also an option...”
- You can **mirror** *everything Bob says* in the CompanionUI live

You're not building a chatbot.
You’re building **a connected logistics brain** that speaks, sees, and thinks in real time.
