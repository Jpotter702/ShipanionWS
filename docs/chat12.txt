Yes — this is the final magic trick of the whole setup. Let’s walk it through step-by-step:

## 🖥️ So... How Does the CompanionUI Get Updated?

### ✅ Short Answer:  
**The UI has its *own WebSocket connection*** — directly to your WebSocket server, **running in parallel** to Bob’s voice agent.

## 🧠 Big Picture Diagram

```plaintext
             🗣️ Voice Agent (Bob)
                    |
     (WebSocket #1) | sends → client_tool_call
                    ↓
         🧠 WebSocket Server (middleware)
                    ↑
     (WebSocket #2) | receives ← contextual_update or tool_result
                    |
           🖥️ CompanionUI Frontend
```

## 🧩 What Happens in Code (Frontend)

### 1. The React frontend runs a WebSocket hook like this:

```ts
useWebSocket("wss://shipvox.com/ws?token=abc123")
```

This connection opens when the page loads.

---

### 2. It listens for incoming messages:

```ts
if (message.type === "quote_ready") {
  dispatch({ type: "ADD_QUOTE", payload: message.payload })
}
```

This updates state — like what quotes to show, or which step is active.

---

### 3. The UI renders the new state:

- `ShippingFeedPage` updates the `StepperAccordion`
- `QuoteCard.tsx` animates into view with price and ETA
- `LabelCard.tsx` displays PDF or QR code
- All **in sync with what Bob is saying**

## ✅ What Types of Messages Update the UI?

| Message Type         | What UI Does                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `quote_ready`        | Show QuoteCards                      |
| `label_created`      | Show label viewer                    |
| `zip_collected`      | Advance stepper to Step 2            |
| `weight_confirmed`   | Show package weight in UI            |
| `pickup_scheduled`   | Show pickup date/time                |

These come from Bob’s tool response OR from your backend itself using `contextual_update`.

## 🔁 Summary

| Channel       | Who Connects | Purpose                         |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| WebSocket #1  | ElevenLabs   | Voice calls tool → gets results |
| WebSocket #2  | CompanionUI  | UI mirrors Bob’s messages       |
| WebSocket Server | You        | Routes both sides in real time |

Would you like me to generate a `useWebSocket.ts` hook stub + reducer for `quote_ready`, or review how `ShippingFeedPage` consumes this flow right now? You're about to hit real-time perfection. 📡🖥️🧠
