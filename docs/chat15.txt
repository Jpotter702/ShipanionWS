✅ In this leg — **right now** — your WebSocket server is sending an **HTTP call** to your ShipVox backend.

## 🧭 You Are Here:

### The message flow is:

```plaintext
🧠 WebSocket Server receives:
{
  "type": "client_tool_call",
  "tool_name": "get_shipping_quotes",
  ...
}
```

### Then it does:

```python
response = await client.post("https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com/get-rates", json=parameters)
```

📡 That is a **regular HTTP POST** to your REST API. Not another WebSocket message.

---

## 🔁 Why?

Because:
- The backend is where the business logic lives (`/get-rates`)
- The WebSocket server is acting like a **proxy** — it’s not running the rate logic itself
- You haven’t merged the two systems *yet*, so HTTP is the bridge

## ✅ So to confirm:

| Action                            | Protocol Used |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| Voice → WebSocket Server          | WebSocket 🔄 |
| WebSocket Server → ShipVox API    | **HTTP POST** ✅ |
| ShipVox API → FedEx/UPS APIs      | HTTP (internal) |
| WebSocket Server → UI & Voice     | WebSocket 🔄 |

Let me know if you want a **debug logger** that shows incoming `client_tool_call` + outgoing `POST /get-rates` payloads in the terminal for testing. Would be super useful right now.
