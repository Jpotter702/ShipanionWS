Excellent question — and you're being smart to ask this **before** making structural changes. Here's what you need to know:

---

## ✅ What You’re Doing:

> “I’m creating a parent directory where both `websockets` and `shipvox_backend` will live side by side — but I’m not merging their Git repos. ShipVox backend still auto-deploys to Render from GitHub.”

✅ That’s totally valid, and Git won’t freak out *as long as* each repo stays isolated.

---

## 🧱 Structure Example

This is what you’re proposing:

```
/shipvox-monorepo (parent dir, not a repo)
├── shipvox_backend/        ← your live repo (Render target)
├── websockets/             ← standalone WebSocket repo
```

As long as **only `shipvox_backend/` is a Git repo**, and Render is watching *that specific path*, everything works cleanly.

## 🔐 Rules to Avoid Git Issues

| Rule | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| 🛑 Do **not** `git init` in the parent folder | You’ll end up with a nested repo mess |
| ✅ Keep `.git/` folder inside only `shipvox_backend/` | Ensures Render sees only what it should |
| 🛑 Don’t symlink or import across dirs (yet) | Unless you’re packaging with poetry or pip |
| ✅ Use `../websockets` as an import path only for local dev | Safe for experimentation, not for production deploys |

---

## 👩‍💻 Bonus Tip: Tell Render to Ignore the Other Directory

If you ever add `websockets/` inside `shipvox_backend/`, update `.renderignore` (like `.dockerignore`) or your `build.sh` script to exclude it.

---

## ✅ TL;DR

| Concern                     | Safe?        |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Two repos in same parent    | ✅ Totally fine |
| Git conflicts from nesting  | ❌ Avoid nested `.git/` folders |
| Render auto-deploy breakage | ❌ Won’t happen if you don’t commit from outside `shipvox_backend/` |

Let me know if you want a little bash script that:
- Creates the directory
- Clones both repos
- Sets Render tracking on just the backend

You're organizing this like a pro. Modular, testable, and deployment-safe. 🧠📦
