✅ **Yes — side-by-side directories are perfectly okay.** That’s a clean, modular setup and Git will have zero problems with it.

## 📂 You’re Safe With This Structure:

```
/shipvox-dev                ← Not a Git repo
├── shipvox_backend/        ← ✅ Git-tracked by Render
│   └── .git/
│   └── main.py
│   └── routes/
│   └── ...
├── websockets/             ← ✅ Your standalone WebSocket service
│   └── .git/
│   └── main.py
│   └── handlers/
│   └── ...
```

---

## 🧠 Git Treats Each as a Separate World

- `cd shipvox_backend/ && git status` = only tracks backend files
- `cd websockets/ && git status` = only tracks websocket files
- Render will **only auto-deploy from `shipvox_backend`**, since that’s the connected GitHub repo
- The parent `/shipvox-dev/` directory has **no Git tracking**, so it’s safe as a dev container

## 🧪 BONUS: Safe Commands You Can Run

```bash
cd ~/shipvox-dev
git clone git@github.com:Jpotter702/shipvox_backend.git
git clone git@github.com:Jpotter702/websockets.git
```

No conflict. No tracking errors.  
No accidental submodule nesting. ✅

---

## 🧯 Just Avoid This One Thing:
```bash
cd ~/shipvox-dev
git init  # ❌ This would try to nest both repos
```

As long as you don’t do that — you’re 100% clear.

Ready to organize this into a shared dev space or `.env` it so you can cross-reference URLs cleanly between the two apps? Or wire up a local test harness that mounts them both with hot reload? You're building a modular dream. 🧠💻
