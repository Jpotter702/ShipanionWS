A consolidated documentation package  to effectively work with the `/get-rates` endpoint and integrate it within the ElevenLabs Conversational AI framework.

## ðŸ“¦ `/get-rates` Endpoint Documentation

### ðŸ”¹ Endpoint

```
POST https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com/get-rates
```

### ðŸ”¹ Request Body (JSON)

```json
{
  "from_zip": "89101",
  "to_zip": "10001",
  "weight": 2
}
```

*Note:* Currently, the endpoint supports FedEx rates. UPS integration is pending due to account setup issues.

### ðŸ”¹ Response Body (JSON)

```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "price": 9.15,
      "eta": "1 day"
    },
    {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "price": 8.44,
      "eta": "2 days"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Note:* The response includes multiple FedEx service options. Filtering logic can be applied client-side or within the WebSocket server to display the most relevant options.

## ðŸ§  ElevenLabs Conversational AI Integration

### ðŸ”¹ WebSocket Communication

ElevenLabs Conversational AI utilizes WebSocket connections for real-time interactions. The agent sends and receives messages in JSON format over this persistent connection.

**Client Tool Call Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "client_tool_call",
  "tool_name": "get_shipping_quotes",
  "tool_call_id": "abc123",
  "parameters": {
    "from_zip": "89101",
    "to_zip": "10001",
    "weight": 2
  }
}
```

**Client Tool Result Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "client_tool_result",
  "tool_call_id": "abc123",
  "result": {
    "quotes": [
      {
        "carrier": "FedEx",
        "price": 9.15,
        "eta": "1 day"
      },
      {
        "carrier": "FedEx",
        "price": 8.44,
        "eta": "2 days"
      }
    ]
  },
  "is_error": false
}
```

*Note:* The `tool_call_id` is used to correlate the request and response.

### ðŸ”¹ Server Tools Configuration

To enable the agent to call external APIs like `/get-rates`, configure a Server Tool in the ElevenLabs dashboard:

- **Name:** `get_shipping_quotes`
- **Description:** Retrieves shipping quotes based on origin, destination, and package weight.
- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com/get-rates`
- **Parameters:**
  - `from_zip` (string, required)
  - `to_zip` (string, required)
  - `weight` (number, required)

*Note:* Ensure that the parameter names in the tool configuration match the keys expected by the `/get-rates` endpoint.
