‚úÖ Exactly right on both counts.

## üåê Backend URL ‚Üí Render Endpoint

Yes ‚Äî the `BACKEND_URL` in your WebSocket server should point to **your deployed ShipVox backend on Render**, where your `POST /get-rates` endpoint lives.

For example:

```env
SHIPVOX_BACKEND_URL=https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com
```

That will make this line hit the live endpoint:
```python
response = await client.post(f"{BACKEND_URL}/get-rates", json=parameters)
```

## üì¶ What the Wonder Twins Will Need

To wire this up cleanly, you‚Äôll want to give them:

### ‚úÖ 1. The URL

```text
https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com/get-rates
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. The Request Schema (POST body)

```json
{
  "from_zip": "89101",
  "to_zip": "10001",
  "weight": 2
}
```

> You could also include `dimensions`, `service_level`, or `package_type` later.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. The Response Format (from your API)

```json
{
  "carrier": "UPS",
  "service": "Ground",
  "price": 8.44,
  "eta": "2 days"
}
```

Or if you‚Äôre returning multiple quotes:

```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "carrier": "UPS",
      "price": 8.44,
      "eta": "2 days"
    },
    {
      "carrier": "FedEx",
      "price": 10.22,
      "eta": "1 day"
    }
  ]
}
```

### üß† Guidance Prompt for the Twins:

> ‚ÄúIn the WebSocket server, when a `client_tool_call` with tool_name `get_shipping_quotes` is received, call the ShipVox backend REST endpoint `POST https://shipvox-backend.onrender.com/get-rates`, passing the parameters in the body. Then wrap the response as a `client_tool_result` and broadcast it over the socket. Include the original `tool_call_id` in the response.‚Äù

Want me to generate a complete `call_get_rates_api()` with error handling + logging next?  
Or move to frontend handling of `client_tool_result` inside `useWebSocket.ts`?
