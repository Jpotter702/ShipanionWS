Ah, good catch â€” and honestly, **totally expected at this stage**.

If your current `/get-rates` endpoint returns **all available FedEx rates** (e.g., SmartPost, 2Day, Express Saver, Ground, etc.), itâ€™s still fine for testing â€” but itâ€™ll flood the WebSocket with more data than the frontend or voice agent expects.

## ðŸ§¹ Options to Clean It Up (Progressively)

### âœ… Option A: Filter on the WebSocket Server (for now)

Quick & simple â€” intercept the response and only forward whatâ€™s useful.

```python
def simplify_rates_response(raw_response: dict) -> dict:
    quotes = raw_response.get("quotes", [])
    filtered = [q for q in quotes if q["carrier"] == "UPS" or q["service"] in ["Ground", "2Day"]]
    return { "quotes": filtered[:2] }  # Limit to top 2 for now
```

Then call this inside your tool router:

```python
raw = await call_get_rates_api(parameters)
result = simplify_rates_response(raw)
```

---

### ðŸ§  Option B: Add Filters to the Backend `/get-rates` API

You could pass additional params like:

```json
{
  "from_zip": "89101",
  "to_zip": "10001",
  "weight": 2,
  "service_filter": ["Ground", "2Day"],
  "max_quotes": 2
}
```

And then inside your backend:
- Only return rates matching the filter
- Limit total results

âœ… This is ideal long-term

### ðŸ§  Option C: Filter on the Frontend (for quote display only)

You could also do this in `ShippingFeedPage.tsx` if:
- You want Bob to speak all the quotes, butâ€¦
- Only show a few in the UI

## TL;DR:

| Fix Location     | Speed | Long-Term Value |
|------------------|-------|------------------|
| WebSocket server | ðŸŸ¢ Fast | ðŸŸ¡ Temporary       |
| Backend filter   | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | ðŸŸ¢ Best option    |
| Frontend only    | ðŸŸ¢ Fast | ðŸ”´ Doesnâ€™t fix Bob |

Want me to write the quick `simplify_rates_response()` function now so you can patch the flood before it hits the frontend?
