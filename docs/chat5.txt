🔧 Great timing for this question — because you're right on the edge of that transition.

Here’s a clear answer with context:

## 🧱 Current Architecture Snapshot

| Component             | Status      | Location                          |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| ShipVox Backend (REST) | ✅ Live     | Render (FastAPI REST)             |
| WebSocket Server       | 🟡 In Progress | Separate FastAPI app             |
| CompanionUI Frontend   | ✅ Live     | Vercel                            |
| ElevenLabs Agent       | ✅ Live     | External                          |

## 🧠 Why Keep WebSockets Separate *for Now*?

- You needed to **stand it up fast** (which we did ✅)
- You needed to test tools like `client_tool_call` without interfering with your production backend
- You’re still iterating on **message format**, **broadcast logic**, and **auth**

This is perfect for prototyping — but not ideal long-term.

## 🔁 When to Merge WebSocket into ShipVox Backend

> **The right moment to unify is after Sprint 1 is complete**, when the WebSocket server:
- ✅ Authenticates JWT clients
- ✅ Routes at least one tool call (`get_shipping_quotes`)
- ✅ Returns `client_tool_result` to voice + UI

At that point:
- The message contract is **stable**
- You’ve verified backend-to-backend call to `/get-rates`
- WebSocket is no longer “experimental middleware” — it’s **core glue**

---

## 🔧 The Unification Plan (Start of Sprint 2)

### ✅ Move WebSocket logic into ShipVox backend under `/realtime` or `/sockets`

Example structure:
```
shipvox-backend/
├── main.py
├── routes/
│   ├── rates.py
│   ├── labels.py
│   └── websocket.py     ← HERE
├── services/
│   └── rates.py
└── utils/
    └── token.py
```

### ✅ Benefits

| Benefit                | Result                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shared service access  | Can call `get_rates()` directly       |
| Shared JWT logic       | Use the same `verify_token()` everywhere |
| Single deployment      | One FastAPI app to rule them all       |
| Simpler ops & scaling  | No need to juggle two APIs             |

## 🚦 What Triggers the Merge?

Here’s your checklist:

- [x] JWT connect auth works
- [x] `get_shipping_quotes` returns cleanly from backend
- [ ] WebSocket server confirmed stable (e.g., no crashes on reconnects)
- [ ] Client-tool flow tested end-to-end

Once those are ✅, we merge WebSocket into the backend and deprecate the standalone server.

Would you like me to generate:
- A `websocket.py` module scaffold ready for drop-in to the backend?
- Or a plan for how to preserve reconnect sessions after the merge?

This is the moment where your architecture graduates from "patch and pipe" to **fully integrated event-based glue.** 🚀
