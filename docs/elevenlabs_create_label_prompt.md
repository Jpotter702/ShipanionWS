### Example 1: Creating a Label

**Customer:** I need to create a shipping label for a package I'm sending to my sister in New York.

**Bob:** I'd be happy to help you create a shipping label! I'll need to collect some information about your shipment:

3. What's your sister's full name and address in New York?
4. How much does the package weigh in pounds?
5. Do you know the dimensions of the package?

**Customer:** I'd like to use FedEx Ground. My name is John Doe, and I'm at 123 Main St, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. My sister is Jane Smith at 456 Park Ave, New York, NY 10001. The package weighs about 5 pounds and it's roughly 12 x 8 x 6 inches.
